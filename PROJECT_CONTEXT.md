# Veterinary Clinic — Project Context

Last reviewed: September 24, 2026

This file is the working context for future development sessions. Read it before making project-wide assumptions or starting a new task.

## 1. What this project is

`veterinary-clinic` is a backend-first veterinary clinic management system. It is intended to manage clinic operations such as:

- Pet owners and their pets
- Pet species and related information
- Veterinarians and their profiles
- Veterinarian availability
- Clinic rooms and room types
- Veterinary visits and appointments
- Visit scheduling, rescheduling, cancellation, and completion
- Authentication and user identity through Keycloak
- Email notifications for visit events
- Clinic administration and future reporting/dashboard functionality

The project is currently focused on the Spring Boot backend. A React administration panel is planned as a later phase.

## 2. Current project maturity

The project has a serious domain-oriented backend foundation and is more than a simple CRUD application. It includes scheduling rules, resource conflict checks, locking, validation, authentication infrastructure, email templates, and pagination/search support.

It is still active development and should not yet be considered production-ready.

Important current state observed on September 24, 2026:

- Check `git status` before editing because user changes may already be in progress.
- `./mvnw -q -DskipTests compile` passes after the current entity and CRUD alignment changes.
- Tests were not run during the September 24, 2026 review. The last recorded test run in this context is from September 21, 2026: 26 tests ran, with 9 failures and 6 errors.
- The previously stale visit-service test has been replaced with a focused four-test suite for `VisitServiceCommandImpl`.
- Security configuration currently permits all requests and therefore bypasses real endpoint protection.
- A Keycloak client secret is currently stored directly in `application-home.yaml` and should be externalized.
- Database schema management currently uses Hibernate `ddl-auto: update`; Flyway configuration is commented out.

The main Java package is:

```text
com.github.farzan6118.petclinic
```

The code is organized mainly by domain feature:

```text
auth/           Authentication endpoints and identity DTOs
common/         Shared exceptions, enums, persistence, pagination, mappers
config/         Spring, security, OpenAPI, Redis/client, and clinic configuration
infrastructure/ External integrations such as Keycloak and email
owner/          Owner entity, DTOs, mapper, repository, service, controller
pet/            Pet and species entities, DTOs, mappers, repositories, services, controllers
clinic/         Clinics, rooms, and room types
vet/            Veterinarians, profiles, and availability
visit/          Visits, duration templates, scheduling, searching, and notifications
```

Resources include:

```text
src/main/resources/application.yaml
src/main/resources/application-home.yaml
src/main/resources/application-company.yaml
src/main/resources/templates/email/...
src/main/resources/docker/mailpit-docker-compose.yml
```

## 5. Domain model

Shared person data lives in `person/`. `Person` stores title, first name, last name, and national ID, and has required one-to-one associations to `Profile` and `Address`. `Profile` stores email, mobile number, birth date, and photo. `Address` stores structured location details and optional coordinates. `Owner` and `Vet` each refer to a `Person`; vet availability remains on `Vet`. Owner and vet create/update requests carry nested `person`, `profile`, and `address` objects, and responses expose the corresponding mapped DTOs. Contact lookups and uniqueness checks therefore follow the `person.profile` relationship.

The central relationship is:

```text
Owner
  └── Pet
        └── Visit
              ├── Vet
              └── Room
```

Important entities include:

- `Owner`: association to a shared `Person`, responsible for one or more pets
- `Pet`: animal belonging to an owner and participating in visits
- `Species`: pet species/type data
- `Vet`: association to a shared `Person` with veterinarian availability
- `Profile`: shared contact details, birth date, and photo for a person
- `Address`: structured address and optional geolocation associated with a person
- `Clinic`: clinic location with a required address
- `Room`: clinic room associated with a clinic and room type
- `VetAvailability`: time periods during which a veterinarian can accept visits
- `RoomType`: classification of clinic rooms
- `Visit`: appointment connecting a pet, veterinarian, time range, visit type, and optionally a room
- `DurationTemplate`: reusable duration configuration, including the `STANDARD` duration used by visit booking
- `MedicalRecord`: clinical record authored by a veterinarian for a pet and associated with a visit; currently connected to persistence and visit completion, but not yet exposed through a medical-record read API

Common enums include:

- `VisitStatus`
- `VisitType`
- `VisitCategory`
- `AppointmentType`
- `AppointmentDuration`
- `SlotStatus`
- `EntityStatus`
- `Sex`

## 6. Visit scheduling behavior

`VisitServiceCommandImpl` contains visit mutations and is currently the most important business service. `VisitServiceQueryImpl` contains visit reads and search operations.

When booking a visit, the service generally:

1. Loads the standard duration template.
2. Builds start and end timestamps.
3. Validates that the time range is valid and remains on one day.
4. Checks clinic working hours and closed days.
5. Loads the veterinarian with a UUID lock.
6. Loads the pet.
7. Selects a suitable room for applicable visit types/categories.
8. Checks veterinarian availability.
9. Checks veterinarian reservation conflicts.
10. Checks room reservation conflicts.
11. Checks pet reservation conflicts.
12. Saves the visit in a transaction.
13. Sends visit notifications by email.

Rescheduling repeats the relevant availability and conflict checks while excluding the current visit from conflict detection.

Visit completion validates the current status and ensures the visit has started but has not already ended.

Visit cancellation is idempotent for already-cancelled visits, but completed visits cannot be cancelled.

Medical records are represented by `pet/model/MedicalRecord.java`. A record links a `Pet`, `Visit`, and `Vet`, and supports consultation, prescription, vaccination, surgery, follow-up, and other record types. It stores diagnosis, clinical notes, treatment plan, prescription text, follow-up information, vaccination details, and surgery details.

The pet package's medical-record feature currently contains:

- `MedicalRecordRepository` for persistence
- `MedicalRecordService` and `MedicalRecordServiceImpl` for creation
- `MedicalRecordMapper` for both request-to-entity and entity-to-response mapping
- `MedicalRecordResponseDto` for the future read API

The visit completion workflow accepts medical-record fields through `CompleteVisitRequestDto`. `VisitServiceCommandImpl.completeVisit(...)` completes the visit and delegates medical-record creation to `MedicalRecordService` in the same outer transaction. The endpoint is intended to be used by the attending vet or an operator entering the vet's clinical result. Authorization rules for those roles are not yet enforced because the current security configuration permits all requests.

The future API should expose a pet's medical-record history to authorized operators and veterinarians. That API has not been added yet.

## 7. API and application behavior

The API is organized under `/api`.

Clinic administration uses `/api/clinics`; room requests refer to a clinic and room type by UUID. Room types, species, pets, vets, and clinics use paginated list responses. CRUD writes validate duplicate natural keys before saving and use soft deletion through `EntityStatus`.

The visit controller currently exposes endpoints for:

- Booking a visit: `POST /api/visits`
- Rescheduling: `PUT /api/visits/{uuid}`
- Listing visits: `GET /api/visits/page`
- Getting one visit: `GET /api/visits/{uuid}`
- Cancelling: `DELETE /api/visits/{uuid}`
- Advanced search: `GET /api/visits/search`
- Completing: `PATCH /api/visits/{uuid}/complete`

DTOs are used for request and response boundaries rather than exposing entities directly.

Pagination is handled with shared request/response DTOs and `PageMapper`.

Validation and application errors are centralized through custom exceptions and `GlobalExceptionHandler`.

## 8. Configuration and local infrastructure

Profiles currently include:

- `home`, active by default through Maven
- `company`

The home profile currently expects:

- PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432`
- Database name `pet_clinic`
- Database user `user`
- Database password `pass`
- Keycloak on `localhost:8180`
- Mailpit SMTP on `localhost:1025`
- Redis on `localhost:6379`
- Application port `8010`

The Docker Compose resource currently defines Mailpit only. PostgreSQL, Redis, and Keycloak are expected to be available separately in the local environment.

Email templates exist for owner and veterinarian notifications for:

- Visit scheduled
- Visit rescheduled
- Visit cancelled
- Checkup reminders for owners

## 9. Security status and required caution

The project has the infrastructure for stateless JWT-based security:

- Spring Security
- OAuth2 Resource Server
- JWT decoder configuration through issuer URI
- Keycloak integration
- Method-security support enabled with `@EnableMethodSecurity`

However, `WebSecurityConfig` currently contains:

```java
.anyRequest().permitAll()
```

This means all endpoints are currently accessible without authentication. The commented `.anyRequest().authenticated()` indicates that the security setup is unfinished or intentionally relaxed for development.

Before deployment, endpoint access rules and method-level authorization must be implemented and tested. Do not assume that the presence of Keycloak configuration means the API is secured.

Also treat the Keycloak client secret in `application-home.yaml` as sensitive. It should be moved to environment variables or an ignored local configuration source.

## 10. Testing status

The main focused test is:

```text
src/test/java/com/github/farzan6118/petclinic/impl/VisitServiceImplTest.java
```

The test suite covers useful scenarios such as:

- Onsite booking
- Online and offsite visits without rooms
- Emergency room selection
- Missing pet/vet cases
- Availability conflicts
- Rescheduling
- Cancellation
- Completion
- Pagination

The focused test suite currently covers one meaningful success path for each command workflow: booking, rescheduling, cancellation, and completion with medical-record creation. It uses `VisitServiceCommandImpl` and mocks its current dependencies.

When changing visit logic, update the focused unit tests first and add integration tests for database locking and overlapping reservations.

Medical-record implementation notes:

- `MedicalRecordMapper.toEntity(...)` currently receives `CompleteVisitRequestDto`, which keeps the completion payload tied to the visit feature. This is acceptable for the current workflow, but a dedicated medical-record creation request DTO may be cleaner when the medical API expands.
- `MedicalRecordServiceImpl` is class-level `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` and its `create(...)` method currently has no method-level write transaction override. This should be corrected before relying on the service independently.
- `VisitServiceCommandImpl` delegates record creation to `MedicalRecordService`; response mapping is prepared for the future medical-record read API.

## 11. Highest-priority technical improvements

Recommended order:

1. Keep `VisitServiceCommandImplTest` focused and green as visit behavior evolves.
2. Restore authentication and define explicit role/permission rules.
3. Remove committed secrets from application configuration.
4. Add Flyway or Liquibase migrations and stop relying on `ddl-auto: update` for deployed environments.
5. Add integration tests for concurrent booking and database lock behavior.
6. Inject a `Clock` instead of calling `LocalDateTime.now()` directly to make time-dependent logic deterministic.
7. Review API status codes and parameter annotations, especially rescheduling and cancellation.
8. Add authorization tests for owners, vets, administrators, and clinic staff.
9. Add observability and operational documentation before production deployment.
10. Build the React administration panel after the API contract stabilizes.

## 12. Review guidance for future tasks

Before making changes, inspect:

1. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
2. `README.md`
3. Relevant domain package
4. Its service, controller, repository, DTOs, mapper, and tests
5. `WebSecurityConfig` if the task touches access control
6. Profile configuration if the task touches infrastructure or external services

Preserve the existing feature-package structure and DTO boundary. Prefer small, coherent changes. Do not assume that a configured integration is active until its runtime configuration and tests confirm it.

For scheduling changes, always consider all four conflict dimensions:

- Veterinarian availability
- Veterinarian reservation overlap
- Pet reservation overlap
- Room reservation overlap

For production-facing changes, also consider transaction boundaries, concurrent requests, timezone behavior, notification failures, authorization, and migration safety.

## 13. Overall assessment

The project has a good architectural direction and a realistic veterinary-clinic domain. Its strongest area is the business-oriented appointment model, which already accounts for real operational constraints instead of treating visits as simple records.

The main weakness is project maturity around reliability: tests have fallen behind implementation changes, security is currently bypassed, and environment secrets/schema management need hardening.

The project is a promising, well-structured backend in active development. The next phase should focus on making the existing foundation trustworthy before adding large new features.
